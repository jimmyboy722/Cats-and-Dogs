# Cats-and-Dogs
Cats and Dogs is a real time weather app where users can search any city by name, and not only see the current weather,
but the 5 day forecast for that city as well.
## Features
 - A simple search box to enter city names that will let you know if your entry is invalid (not a city)
 - Current weather is displayed large at the top of the screen for easy identification
 - 5 day forecast is located directly under the current weather for whatever city you search.
 - Current and future weather data includes the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the weather condiiton.

## How was this achieved?
 - Cats and Dogs weather app gets its weather info from a server side API called "Openweather API" (https://openweathermap.org/api).
 - This API allowed me to select details such as the city, temperatures (including what unit of temp), and basically all aspects of weather.
 - Using parameters in the url request and a fetch request for the weather data.

## The following is a screen shot of the app, followed by a link to the deployed applicaiton. Hope you enjoy!
